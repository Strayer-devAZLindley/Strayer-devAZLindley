- 👋 Hi, I’m Adreanna!
- 👀 I’m interested in ...coding, website design, adult coloring, and calligraphy. My sons are my true loves, but since they left home, I am a passionate "Fur Momma" to my babies! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript and dabbling with API's
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...I'd really like to get involved with the ASPCA or the Humane Society to help get shelter animals adopted. I really need to get involved in some beginner friendly open source projects as well if anyone has any suggestions. I'm also very fond of building beautiful websites with CSS and if there's one thing I've noticed since the Pandemic is that people need to update their websites BADLY! I'd love to help out with that!
- 📫 How to reach me ...You can email me at adreanna.lindley@my.strayer.edu or azlindley@yahoo.com. The student address is probably the quickest way to get in touch with me because I check it every day!
